# Web-based nonogram puzzle

Includes 3 hard-coded puzzles ([source](https://nonogramskatana.blogspot.com/)). Right-click to fill in a square with black, left-click to mark it as empty. Right-clicking can be undone by right-clicking once again. Left-clicking cannot be undone, and too many mistakes will lead to a loss.

Not mobile-responsive.
